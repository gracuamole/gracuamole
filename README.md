- 👋 Hi, I’m @gracuamole
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics, and I specialise in working with financial data.
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a data product management intern at GovTech Singapore, where I build Qliksense dashboards using citizen data, in order to improve service delivery at service centres across Singapore. My team is also working on developing the business use cases for a data warehouse for the whole of government.
- 📊 After hours, I am learning about the ETL process and how a data warehouse is developed in order to supplement my 9-5 work. I am also working on Kaggle datasets to develop machine learning models.
- 💞️ I’m looking for mentors and internship opportunities to work as a financial data analyst.
